There are certain areas of the map which you can 'enter'. These locations include 'human territory', 'elf territory', 'forest', and 'tavern'. To enter one of these places, type 'enter ' and then the location. You can only enter these places from certain points on the map, however. \\n\\nWhile inside the tavern you must use commands 'go left' and 'go right' to navigate. \\n\\nAs you explore the world, you may encounter characters you wish to interact with. To do so, type 'talk to '. \\n\\nThere are also objects that you can interact with around the world. Some objects you can learn more about by entering 'inspect ' and the name of the object. Be warned, some object descriptions change the more you interact with and learn about the world and the people in it. \\n\\nThere are also objects you can add to your inventory by using the command 'take ' and the name of the object. This comes in handy when you need to use an object or bring an object somewhere else. You can see what's in your inventory at any time by typing 'open inventory'. If you no longer need or wish to carry an object, enter 'drop ' and the name of the object to put it down. \\n\\nThere are some objects that are too heavy for you to take. On rare occasions you can 'move' these objects by entering 'move ' and the name of the object. \\n\\nThere are slo different ways to use objects. Use your best judgement. If nothing happens, make sure you spelled everything correctly. It's also possible you tried to use an object in a way it can't be used. This game is all about exploration, so don't be afraid to mess around. \\n\\nPress 'i' at any time to recieve a refresher on these instructions.\\n\\n\")\n",
