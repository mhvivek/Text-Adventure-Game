Once you're there, use the commands 'go left' and 'go right' to explore the building. When you wish to leave, enter 'exit tavern'. You can also enter the human and elf territories as well as the forest from certian locations. To do so, enter 'enter human/elf territory' or 'enter forest'. To return to the main map use 'exit human/elf territory' or 'exit forest'. You can always press 'i' to get a refresher on these instructions. Have fun!\")\n",
